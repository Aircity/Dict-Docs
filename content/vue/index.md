| interpolation   |               | In addition to text interpolation, we can also bind element attributes like this |

| presence        |               | It’s easy to toggle the presence of an element |
| demonstrate     |               | This example demonstrates that we can bind data to not only text and attributes, but also the **structure** of the DOM |

| transition      |               | Vue also provides a powerful transition effect system that can automatically apply [transition effects](https://vuejs.org/v2/guide/transitions.html) when elements are inserted/updated/removed by Vue |
| invoke          |               |                                          |

| breeze          | make…a breeze | Vue also provides the `v-model` directive that makes two-way binding between form input and app state a breeze. |
